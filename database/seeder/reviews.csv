Elene Mikaberidze,February 2019, The owner wouldn't let me bring my pet bear. Very much worth it. The torcher chamber was a bit too much. NO INDOOR PLUMBING!! I want my money back. The town was very cute. BE WARNED! Why didn't I find this place sooner? The view form the back porch was to die for. We had so much fun! I wish I could have stayed longer. And I would do it again! This place is awesome! You can tell the owner really likes bears. I came here for my honemoon. I do not regret anything! It was quite a drive from the airport. The owner has the best style. But the owner was cool. But seriously tell all your friends! The place smelled very bad!,https://beartnt-profile-photos.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/beartnt+profile+photos/pexels-photo-5853675.jpeg,99
